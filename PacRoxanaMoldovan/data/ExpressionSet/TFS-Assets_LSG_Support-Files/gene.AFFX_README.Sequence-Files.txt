I. Note regarding genome assembly version
------------------------------------------

The genome assembly version for the array design data included in the
data file bundled with this readme is indicated both in the data file
name, which contains a genome version identifier (e.g., ".hg18."
for data based on the UCSC hg18 build) and within each data line 
within the files (tab column, or fasta description). The data lines
may contain alternative identifiers for the genome assembly version,
such as the NCBI build and the UCSC version id, separated by a forward
slash (e.g., "build-36/hg18"). 

Array designs are occasionally mapped or "lifted" to an updated
version of the genome assembly for improved annotation by the NetAffx
Analysis Center. Some of the array sequences may fail to be mapped to
the updated genome version. In this case, the information in the data
line for the unmappable sequences will be based on the original
design-time genome version that the array design was based on.

The lines at the top of this readme labeled "Genome assembly, design" and 
"Genome assembly, annot" indicate the design-time vs. annotation-time
version of the genome assembly on which the data in this file may be
based. The annotation-time genome corresponds the the version
currently used by the NetAffx Analysis Center.

You can tell whether or not the array sequence data file is based on a
mapped array design by inspecting the file name which will indicate
the associated genome assembly version (as described above). If the
file name contains an assembly identifier corresponding to the
annotation-time genome version and this version is different from the
design-time genome version, then the information in the file has been
mapped, and the unmappable sequence data will be from the design-time
genome version. Otherwise, all data in the file are based on the
original design-time genome version. In either case, the genome
assembly version for a given data line will always be specified in the
line itself.

Data potentially affected by the genome assembly version includes:

  * genome location: chromosome (seqname), start, stop, strand
  * transcript cluster sequence (consists of spliced exon clusters)

Probe sequences themselves are not affected by the genome assembly
version since they are fixed at array design time.


II. Probe Sequence Files
-----------------------

All probe sequences, in both fasta and tabular format, are provided in
the orientation they exist on the array and in the 5'->3'
direction. For a sense target (st) array such as the gene and exon
arrays, this corresponds to the reverse complement of the orientation
of the target mRNA sequence.

The probe sequence files include control probes in addition to
all probes from the main design.

Note that for gene array designs, a given probe located at a given x
and y location on the array may be associated with more than one
transcript cluster. Therefore, a probe ID may occur more than once
with both the probe tab and fasta files. However, each probe ID +
transcript cluster ID combination is unique within these files.

II.A. Probe fasta file

   The probe fasta file contains all probe sequences from the array in
   fasta format. A unique identifier for each sequence is composed of
   'probe' followed by the array type followed by the probe ID and
   transcript cluster ID separated by a hyphen followed by the x and y
   position of the probe on the array, with each of these items
   separated by a colon ':' character. The identifier is termined by a
   semicolon ';'. See example below.

   II.A.1. Description line attributes

   Additional attributes for each probe are included in the
   description line in tag=value pairs. The following tags are
   provided: 

      Attribute                Description
    -------------          ------------------------------------------
      ProbeID               Probe identifier (integer)
      TranscriptClusterID   Transcript Cluster identifier (integer)
      Assembly              Genome assembly version
      Seqname               Sequence name for genomic location of probe (chromosome)
      Start                 Starting coordinate of probe genomic location (1-based)
      Stop                  Ending coordinate of probe genomic location (1-based)
      Strand                Sequence strand of probe genomic location (+ or -)
      Sense/Antisense       Strandedness of the target which the probe detects
      category              Array design category of the probe (described below)

     * Note: The sense/antisense field is the only one that is not
       tag=value, but is either the string 'Sense' or 'Antisense'.

   human gene array.

II.B. Probe tabular file

II.C. Array design categories

    Both the probe fasta and tab files contain an indication of the
    array design category of each probe. Here is a description of the
    different types of categories.

              Category                   Description
       ------------------------    --------------------------------------
        main                       part of the main design 
        control->affx              a standard AFFX control
        control->chip              a chip control
        control->bgp->antigenomic  antigenomic background probes
        control->bgp->genomic      genomic background probes 
        normgene->exon             from an exonic region of a
                                   normalization control gene   
        normgene->intron           from an intronic region of a
                                   normalization control gene 
        rescue->FLmRNA->unmapped   probes were tiled across an mRNA
                                   transcript which either did not align
                                   to the genome, or aligned poorly  


III. Transcript Cluster Sequence File
-------------------------------------

Transcript cluster sequences are created by removing all intronic
regions from the transcript cluster sequence and splicing
together all constituent exons into a single sequence for each
transcript cluster. They are provided in the orientation they exist in
the mRNA in 5'->3' direction.

The length given for the transcript cluster sequence is the total
length of all spliced exon clusters within the transcript cluster,
removing any intronic sequence. This will differ from the length
obtained by taking the difference between the start and stop
genomic coordinates for the transcript cluster, which would include
any intronic sequence.

The transcript cluster sequence file does not include any
controls, only entries from the main design. 

III.A. Transcript cluster fasta file

   The transcript cluster fasta sequence file contains transcript
   cluster sequences from the array in fasta format. The identifier is
   composed of 'transcript_cluster' followed by the array type
   followed by the transcript cluster ID, with each of these items
   separate by a colon ':' character. The identifier is termined by a
   semicolon ';'.

   III.A.1. Description line attributes

   Additional attributes for each transcript cluster are included in
   the description line in tag=value pairs. The following tags are
   provided:

      Attribute                Description
    -------------    ------------------------------------------
      Assembly        Genome assembly version
      Seqname         Sequence name for genomic location of TC (chromosome)
      Start           Starting coordinate of TC genomic location (1-based)
      Stop            Ending coordinate of TC genomic location (1-based)
      Strand          Sequence strand of TC genomic location (+ or -)
      Length          Length of concatenated exon clusters in the TC
